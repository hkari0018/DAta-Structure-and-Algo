***Write a program to print all the LEADERS in the array. An element is leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side. 
And the rightmost element is always a leader.
For example int the array {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}, leaders are 17, 5 and 2. ***


def Leader(arr,size):
  max_from_right=arr[size-1]      #let max from right be the last element
  print(max_from_right)           
  for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):        #loop from rightmost till we get gteter element
    if max_from_right <arr[i]:        #print that element and let max be that element
      print(arr[i])
      max_from_right=arr[i]
  
  arr = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
leader(arr,len(arr))
